    "And once we were able to add day of the week to our data set from py.spark.sql function and implement it correctlt, I realized that there probably is a ton of merit in that essence, and such that each day of the week (and the activities) associate it, undoubtedly probably play a huge part in affecting the load consumption of that day.  \n",
    "\n",
    "And that if we could integrate it, into our dataset (a series of words asscociated with each day), we could certainly make a model that hopefully makes a prediction with greater accuracy but also it gives us a chance to do NLP and NLTK (which I know was a huge part of our 612 course), so please think of this an added bonus and ensuring to incorporate all the cool things I learned in 612."

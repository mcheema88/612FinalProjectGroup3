    "#Cleaning and Combining Weather Data\n",
    "This step was perhaps the most energy consuming when it comes to our data apprehensions itself, and while we tried to prevent to get to the files in our database we had some manual work.\n",
    "\n",
    "https://acis.alberta.ca/weather-data-viewer.jsp  \n",
    "\n",
    "To access weather data you could choose a weather station, and then from there download the data you needed (daily, hourly ect), of your choice, this website however enforced a CAPTCHA which for our skillset prevented an automated request, what also was interesting was that because our AESO DATA had it's own specific \"regions\", we had to be diligent to choose a weather station that we believed existed within the defined AESO region.  \n",
    "\n",
    "We referenced this AESO MAP, which shows the boundaries of each Region that is used for our AESO Load Data.  \n",
    "https://www.arcgis.com/apps/View/index.html?appid=88859e0179b44b47b3e77b0b384a18a7  \n",
    "\n",
    "This was super helpful as our Weather Data also had an interactive map on the data page which showed the location of each weather station so through overlaying them, we could effectively choose a weather station that fell within the region (this map can be seen in the weather data link provided above).\n",
    "\n",
    "This still left with the problem that limitations of our Weather data download could only be for to 184 days (while this was not ideal, it does give a great opportunity to demonstrate our data parsing and combining skills which will be done below0.  \n",
    "\n",
    "So after identifying a station that fell into each of the AESO regions, we download 3 files for each station of HOURLY weather data which corresponded to 2023-11-01 - 2024-05-05,  2024-05-06 - 2024-10-01,  and finally 2024-10-02 - 2024-12-31, these dates are apart of the download file for our WEATHER DATA and together represent the timeline of our AESO LOAD data which is from 2023-11-01 - 2024-12-31 also HOURLY so this was inetntional so that of course we can match our data sets perfectly.  \n",
    "\n",
    "However because our decisions of Weather Data Station belonging to a AESO region was a manual decision with no clear way to automate, each weather station CSV was just renamed at the end by adding the Region of our Choice (numerical number) to the end of the CSV name, which is found in our data folder under WeatherDataRaw, as everything is untouched and represents 42 Weather Stations data (representing the 42 Aeso Regions) x 3 (as we had to download the weather data again in chunks of 3 for each station.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Below is our process of combining the 3 sets of data for the station into 1 dataframe for each station."
